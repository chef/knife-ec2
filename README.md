## Installation
If you're using [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/), simply install the Gem:

```bash
$ chef gem install knife-ec2
```

If you're using bundler, simply add Chef and Knife EC2 to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'knife-ec2'
```

If you are not using bundler, you can install the gem manually from Rubygems:

```bash
$ gem install knife-ec2
```

Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to run this command with root privileges.

## Configuration
In order to communicate with the Amazon's EC2 API you will need to pass Knife your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, and if using STS your session token. This can be done in several ways:

### Knife.rb Configuration
The easiest way to configure your Amazon EC2 credentials for knife-ec2 is to specify them in your your `knife.rb` file:

```ruby
knife[:aws_access_key_id] = "Your AWS Access Key ID"
knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "Your AWS Secret Access Key"
```

Additionally if using AWS STS:

```ruby
knife[:aws_session_token] = "Your AWS Session Token"
```

Note: If your `knife.rb` file will be checked into a source control management system, or is otherwise accessible by others, you may want to use one of the other configuration methods to avoid exposing your credentials.

### Environmental Variables
Knife-ec2 can also read your credentials from shell environmental variables. Export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` variables in your shell then add the following configuration to your `knife.rb` file:

```ruby
knife[:aws_access_key_id] = ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']
knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
```

Additionally if using AWS STS:

```ruby
knife[:aws_session_token] = ENV['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN']
```

### CLI Arguments
You also have the option of passing your AWS API Key/Secret into the individual knife subcommands using the `--aws-access-key-id` and `--aws-secret-access-key` command options

Example of provisioning a new t2.micro Ubuntu 14.04 webserver:

```bash
$ knife ec2 server create -r 'role[webserver]' -I ami-cd0fd6be -f t2.micro --aws-access-key-id 'Your AWS Access Key ID' --aws-secret-access-key "Your AWS Secret Access Key"
```

### AWS Credential File
Amazon's newer credential config file format is also supported by knife:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = Your AWS Access Key ID
aws_secret_access_key = Your AWS Secret Access Key
```

In this case, you can point the `aws_credential_file` option to this file in your `knife.rb` file, like so:

```ruby
knife[:aws_credential_file] = "/path/to/credentials/file"
```
Since the Knife config file is just Ruby you can also avoid hardcoding your home directory, which creates a configuration that can be used for any user:

```ruby
knife[:aws_credential_file] = File.join(ENV['HOME'], "/.aws/credentials")
```


If you have multiple profiles in your credentials file you can define which profile to use. The `default` profile will be used if not supplied,

```ruby
knife[:aws_profile] = "personal"
```

### AWS Configuration File
Amazon's newer configuration file format is also supported by knife:

```
[default]
region = "specify_any_supported_region"
```

In this case you can point the `aws_config_file` option to this file in your `knife.rb` file, like so:

```ruby
knife[:aws_config_file] = "/path/to/configuration/file"
```
Since the Knife config is just Ruby you can also avoid hardcoding your name directory, which creates a config that can be used for any user:

```ruby
knife[:aws_config_file] = File.join(ENV['HOME'], "/.aws/configuration")
```


If you have multiple profiles in your configuration file you can define which profile to use. The `default` profile will be used if not supplied,

```ruby
knife[:aws_profile] = "personal"
```

In this case configuration file format is:
```
[profile personal]
region = "specify_any_supported_region"
```


## Additional knife.rb Configuration Options
The following configuration options may be set in your `knife.rb`:
- flavor
- image
- availability_zone
- ssh_key_name
- aws_session_token
- region
- distro
- template_file

## Using Cloud-Based Secret Data
knife-ec2 now includes the ability to retrieve the encrypted data bag secret and validation keys directly from a cloud-based assets store (currently only S3 is supported). To enable this functionality, you must first upload keys to S3 and give them appropriate permissions. The following is a suggested set of IAM permissions required to make this work:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::example.com/chef/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Supported URL format
- `http` or `https` based: 'http://example.com/chef/my-validator.pem'
- `s3` based:  's3://chef/my-validator.pem'

### Use the following configuration options in `knife.rb` to set the source URLs:

```ruby
knife[:validation_key_url] = 'http://example.com/chef/my-validator.pem'
knife[:s3_secret] = 'http://example.com/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret'
```

### Alternatively, URLs can be passed directly on the command line:
- Validation Key: `--validation-key-url s3://chef/my-validator.pem`
- Encrypted Data Bag Secret: `--s3-secret s3://chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret`

## knife-ec2 Subcommands
This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands. Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a `--help` flag

### `knife ec2 server create`
Provisions a new server in the Amazon EC2 and then perform a Chef bootstrap (using the SSH or WinRM protocols). The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed on the target system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server. The main assumption is a baseline OS installation exists (provided by the provisioning). It is primarily intended for Chef Client systems that talk to a Chef server.  The examples below create Linux and Windows instances:

```
# Create some instances -- knife configuration contains the AWS credentials

# A Linux instance via ssh
knife ec2 server create -I ami-d0f89fb9 --ssh-key your-public-key-id -f m1.medium --ssh-user ubuntu --identity-file ~/.ssh/your-private-key

# A Windows instance via the WinRM protocol -- --ssh-key is still required due to EC2 API operations that need it to grant access to the Windows instance
# `--spot-price` option lets you specify the spot pricing
knife ec2 server create -I ami-173d747e -G windows -f m1.medium --user-data ~/your-user-data-file -x '.\a_local_user' -P 'yourpassword' --ssh-key your-public-key-id --spot-price price-in-USD

# Pass --server-connect-attribute to specify the instance attribute that we will try to connect to via ssh/winrm
# Possible values of --server-connect-attribute: private_dns_name, private_ip_address, dns_name, public_ip_address
# If --server-connect-attribute is not specified, knife attempts to determine if connecting to the instance's public or private IP is most appropriate based on other settings
knife ec2 server create -I ami-173d747e -x ubuntu --server-connect-attribute public_ip_address
```

View additional information on configuring Windows images for bootstrap in the documentation for [knife-windows](https://docs.chef.io/plugin_knife_windows.html).


#### Bootstrap Windows instance without user-data through winrm ssl transport

Users can bootstrap the Windows instance without the need to provide the user-data. `knife-ec2` has the ability to bootstrap the Windows instance through `winrm protocol` using the `ssl` transport. This require users to set `--winrm-transport` option as `ssl`, `--winrm-authentication-protocol` option as `negotiate` and `--winrm-ssl-verify-mode` option as `verify_none`. This will reduce the users overhead as they would not be required to pass any user-data to configure the winrm for bootstrapping the instance.

***Note***: Users also need to pass the `security_group` with having the required ports opened like `5986` for `winrm ssl transport`.

Below is the sample command to create a Windows instance and bootstrap it through `ssl` transport without passing any user-data:

```
knife ec2 server create -N chef-node-name -I your-windows-image -f flavor-of-server -x '.\a_local_user' -P 'yourpassword' --ssh-key your-public-key-id --winrm-transport ssl --winrm-authentication-protocol negotiate --winrm-ssl-verify-mode verify_none --security-group-ids your-security-groups -VV
```

#### Bootstrap Windows instance with user-data through winrm plaintext transport

Users can bootstrap the Windows instance through `winrm plaintext transport` as well. But for this users need to pass the user-data along with `--winrm-transport` option as `plaintext` and `--winrm-authentication-protocol` option as `basic`.

***Note***: Users also need to pass the `security_group` with having the required ports opened like `5985` for `winrm plaintext transport`.

Below is the sample user-data that users can use for `plaintext` transport:

```
<powershell>

$user=<user_name>
$password=<password>

net user /add $user $password;
net localgroup Administrators /add $user;

winrm quickconfig -q
winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="300"}'
winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'

netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" profile=public protocol=tcp localport=5985 remoteip=localsubnet new remoteip=any

</powershell>
```

Below is the sample command to create a Windows instance and bootstrap it through `plaintext` transport by passing the user-data:

```
knife ec2 server create -N chef-node-name -I your-windows-image -f flavor-of-server -x '.\a_local_user' -P 'yourpassword' --ssh-key your-public-key-id --winrm-transport plaintext --winrm-authentication-protocol basic --security-group-ids your-security-groups -VV
```


#### Options for bootstrapping Windows
The `knife ec2 server create` command also supports the following options for bootstrapping a Windows node after the VM s created:

```
:winrm_password                The WinRM password
:winrm_authentication_protocol Defaults to negotiate, supports kerberos, can be set to basic for debugging
:winrm_transport               Defaults to plaintext, use ssl for improved security
:winrm_port                    Defaults to 5985 plaintext transport, or 5986 for SSL
:ca_trust_file                 The CA certificate file to use to verify the server when using SSL
:winrm_ssl_verify_mode         Defaults to verify_peer, use verify_none to skip validation of the server certificate during testing
:kerberos_keytab_file          The Kerberos keytab file used for authentication
:kerberos_realm                The Kerberos realm used for authentication
:kerberos_service              The Kerberos service used for authentication
```

### `knife ec2 server delete`
Deletes an existing server in the currently configured AWS account. **By default, this does not delete the associated node and client objects from the Chef server. To do so, add the `--purge` flag**

### `knife ec2 server list`
Outputs a list of all servers in the currently configured AWS account. **Note, this shows all instances associated with the account, some of which may not be currently managed by the Chef server.**
