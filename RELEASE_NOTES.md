# knife-ec2 0.12.0 release notes:

This release of `knife-ec2` adds features like spot pricing, EBS volume encryption support and some bug fixes. There is also a dependency update for the `fog` gem and 'em-winrm' dependency is removed.

## Compatibility note for Windows nodes: `--winrm-authentication-protocol basic`
In this version of `knife-ec2`, the default authentication protocol
for Windows nodes is now `negotiate`for the `server create` subcommand. This can
cause bootstraps to fail if the remote Windows node is not configured
for `negotiate`. To work around this and retain the behavior of
previous releases, you can specify use `basic` authentication in your
`knife` configuration file or on the command line  as in
this example:

        knife ec2 server create -I ami-173d747e -G windows -f m1.medium --user-data ~/your-user-data-file -x 'a_local_user' -P 'yourpassword' --ssh-key your-public-key-id --winrm-authentication-protocol basic

## Acknowledgements
Our thanks go to contributor **Peer Allan** for adding
[knife-ec2:#305](https://github.com/chef/knife-ec2/pull/305). This
enables the use of standard AWS credential configuration from `~/.aws/credentials`.
